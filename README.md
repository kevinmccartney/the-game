## GCP Setup

- Create a the project (in our case "The Game")
- Run `terrraform init && terraform apply` locally to create the Terraform state bucket on commit [f0934af](https://github.com/kevinmccartney/the-game/commit/f0934af65173ef19815850bab9aac7ea655dfb02)
- Run `terraform init` locally after setting up the backend on commit [c3df2dd](https://github.com/kevinmccartney/the-game/commit/c3df2dd0ed11970709ca842a56e6cd3513769422) to set up the GCP GCS bucket Terraform state backend
- Create a service account called `github-cicd` in the `The Game` project with the `Editor` role.
- Create a JSON service account key for `github-cicd`
- Create a new actions secret called `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` that contains the service account credentials
  - Make sure the json string is all on one line (no newlines)
- Create a new actions secret called `GCP_REGION` that contains the GCP region
- Create a new actions secret called `GCP_PROJECT` that contains the GCP project ID
- Before building the web host GCS buckets, make sure to verify the domain & add the service account email on the [Webmaster Central](https://www.google.com/webmasters/verification/home?hl=en)
- Your service account will need the Storage Admin (roles/storage.admin) role on "The Game" project to update the IAM policy on the bucket
- Make sure the Service Usage & Cloud Resource Manager services are enabled
  - `gcloud services enable serviceusage.googleapis.com cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com --project {project_id}`
  - _This will allow you to export infrastructure created in the GCP console & imported into Terraform state if you get stuck_
- Make sure you create the LB before the cert

- Create domain DNS A record in your project that contains DNS (not in scope for now) pointed to the LB frontend IP

| DNS Name                | Resource Record Type | TTL                     | IPv4 Address          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| the-game.{your-domain}. | A                    | 300 seconds (5 minutes) | {your-lb-frontend-ip} |

- Set up Oauth consent screen
